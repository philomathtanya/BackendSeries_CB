DATABASE: 

-> Data: The all data present inside datebase is called data.
-> Information: User useful data present inside the database in called Information.

There are two type of Storage Management: 

        -> File System:
                    - File System is not used as storage for projects.
                    - We used Database for te projects.
                    - File system has problem of Data redundency(Mother problem) , Data Inconsistancy.
                    - While changing data in one File data will not change in other file.
                    - Less Security
                    - Note easy to handle large amount of data.

        -> DataBase:
                    - Data base is used for projects.
                    - While change in one file data is automatically change in other file.
                    - It is very easy to manage the large files.
                    - It can not easily hacked the database.
                    - High Security.
                    - Layers of Abstraction.

    DATABASE:

                -> SQL: - Stands for Standard Query Language.
                        - EX: MySql, Oracle, MS Sql Server, Regid Structure.    

                -> NoSQL: 
                        - Stands for Not Only Sql
                        - EX: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Document DB(AWS), Flexible Structure.
    
    DBMS: - DBMS Stand for Database Management System, It is the software which help us to intract with SQL.
          - There are two types of database:
                    ->RDBMS: Relational atabase management System used to store data in Tables.
                    ->NRDBMS: Non Relational DataBase Management System Data is not Stored in Tables.

    What to Choose for projects SQL or NoSql?

    CAP Theorem: Consistency Avilability PArtation Tolerance
    - SQL offes more Consistancy.
    - Nosql offers more Abalability.
    - SQL & Nosql both offer same Partition tolerance change in data reflect to ther side.

==================================================MONGODB==========================================================

    -> It is the type of NoSql Database which store data in the form of JSON.
            EX: 
            {
                {
                    "id":1,
                    "Name":"RItesh Verma",
                    "City":"Mathura"
                },
                {
                    "id":2,
                    "Name":"Tanya Bansal",
                    "City":"Delhi"
                }
            }
    
    -> MongoDB is good to use with node and express.
    -> MEAN, MERN, MEVN in this all M stands for MongoDB.
    -> Easy to Pickup this.
    -> Syntaxs are just similar to the JavaScript.
    -> To used this we have to install mongodb community edition and mongodb shell and Mongodb Compass.

                            documents    Documents     Documents  

Collection: It is the folder inside Database.
Document: It is the single record present in collection.

JSON vs BSON
JSON: Javascript objejct notation
BSON: Binary JSON
 -> JSON istext based format and text processing is very slow.
 -> JSON is Readble format.
 -> JSON is not Space Efficient.
 ->JSON have limited number of datatypes.
 # JSON file is converted into BSON to store because BSON takes less storage and again converted into JSON to further operations.
