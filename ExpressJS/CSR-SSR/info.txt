CSR: CSR stands for the client Side Rendering.
SSR: SSR stands for the server side rendering.

-> In Client side rendering we are making the AJAX request to the server
    and through the JS layer we ger the response from the server
    and using the dom manipulation we are print thr data on the HTML page.
        - Here we are using the normal HTML and javascript file to sedn the request.
        - CSR is less Secure because javascript file data is openly available to edit.
        
-> In Server Side rendering we are not creating the AJAX request we are just
     creating the normal request using the ejs files.
     - Here we are using the ejs or RESTFUL routing.
     - SSR is more Secure because javascript file is not openly available to edit .
    
# req.xhr is the object key which return that the request made is AJAX request or normal request.
    -> If req.xhr return TRUE it means that it is the AJAX request.
    -> IF req.xhr return FALSE it means that it is the normal ejs request or Server side request.
