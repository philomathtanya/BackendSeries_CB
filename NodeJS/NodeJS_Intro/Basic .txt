NodeJS:-
In 2009 Browser have layout engine and Javascript engine .In chrome Layout engine is blink and js engine is V8 
It is the run time enviroment.
-> As server consist of database and client is sending request to server for some specific data, server return
    data in the form of JSON from the Database as as response.
-> Server is just a program who is capable to analys the request made by client, which make is Searchble.
-> Spider Monkey is the first javascrpit engine used in firefox.
-> V8 is the JS engine of the chrome,to extract the Sourse Code of JS engine and run it we need NODEJS.
-> NodeJS is nothing it is Javascript runtime Enviroment.
-> NodeJS is just used to execute the JS code outside the browser.
-> NodeJS is just based on V8 js engine.
 
What is the need of NodeJS ?
-We can write WebServer, Command Line tools.
-Many modules are present that help to Create Native Application.
-It help to Javascript as Backend.
-Creating Drone Softwares

MEAN: MongoDB Express Angular NodeJS
MERN: MongoDb Express React NodeJS

JS in Browser: 
- Dont have Access to file System.
- Window Object Present.
- Document API Present(DOM).

JS in NodeJS:
- Access , Work with the file System.
- Global obejct named global.
- Do not have DOM API.

==================================================================================================================

# NodeJS contain same variables , functions , methods,  Objects, Arrays as Same used in JavaScript
# No Window Function.
# No DOM Manipulation
# Process Object is present in NodeJS which is not present in JS , Precess Object contains all the 
    information about the real time process.
# Process.argv- contain two path as array ,where the first path contain path of node and second path shows the path of current file.
# By runnig  JS file Like: "node index.js Ritesh Verma" to ritesh and verma is added to the Process.argv which is accessable and work as input.
# Process.cwd- Current Working Directory which give the path of the folder from where we are running the js file.

==================================================================================================================

-> JS and NodeJS have same Functionality outside but differeent imprelemtation inside.
-> There are many packages in the nodeJS like filesystem,path,https server,OS.
-> Every language have there central package manager here simpally package is the software, library or frameWork.
-> Central package manager in nodejs is the Node pakage Manager(npm) for JS.
-> Using npm we can use the code written bu someone else.
-> Npm is nothing it is the repository of the packages, it is allso the command line tool.
-> Npm is the world largest software registary.
